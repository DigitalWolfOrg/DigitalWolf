      question: "What is native app development?",
      answer:
        "Native app development involves creating applications specifically for a single platform, such as iOS or Android, using platform-specific programming languages like Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android. These apps are optimized for performance and provide seamless user experiences by leveraging device-specific features.",
    },
    {
      questionId: "02",
      question:
        "Are native apps better?",
      answer:
        "Native apps typically offer better performance, speed, and user experience compared to hybrid apps. They are designed to fully utilize device hardware and features, providing a smoother, more responsive experience that aligns with platform guidelines, making them ideal for apps requiring high functionality.",
    },
    {
      questionId: "03",
      question:
        "What is the difference between native app and hybrid app?",
      answer:
        "A native app is developed for a specific platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific programming languages, offering optimal performance. A hybrid app, on the other hand, is built using a single codebase and runs on multiple platforms but may compromise performance and user experience.",
    },
    {
      questionId: "04",
      question: "What is the advantage of a native app?",
      answer:
        "Native apps provide faster performance, enhanced security, and access to device-specific features, resulting in better user experiences. They also have superior offline capabilities and are more compatible with app store requirements, boosting visibility and monetization potential.",
    },
    {
      questionId: "05",
      question: "Is the native app safe?",
      answer:
        "Yes, native apps are generally safer than hybrid apps as they are built with platform-specific security features, including encrypted data storage, authentication, and privacy settings. Additionally, they comply with the strict security policies of app stores, ensuring higher data protection and reliability.",
